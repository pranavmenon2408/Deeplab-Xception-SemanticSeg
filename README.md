# DeepLab-Xception Semantic Segmentation

This repository contains an implementation of the DeepLab v3+ architecture using an Aligned Xception backbone for performing semantic segmentation. It is designed for urban scene understanding and works well with datasets like the Indian Driving Dataset or Cityscapes.

---

## 🔍 Overview

DeepLab v3+ is a state-of-the-art semantic segmentation model that combines atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) with a decoder module for precise object boundary delineation. This repo uses an Aligned Xception backbone for improved feature extraction.
